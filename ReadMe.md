😊 Fitsum’s React Portfolio & Fun Starter Kit 

Welcome to a cozy corner of code crafted by Fitsum Zerihun—13 years deep in IT wizardry, now orbiting at NASA! This isn’t just another boilerplate; it’s a vibrant playground designed to showcase your talent, tinker freely, and ship delightful web experiences.

😍 What Makes This App Special

Personal Touch: Built by Fitsum—a graphic designer turned full-stack website developer with a passion for AI & Ethiopian cyberspace. You’ll peek into real-world experience, not sterile tutorials.

No Secrets, All Fun: Dive straight into clear, well-organized React components. Peek at the code, tweak it, break it, and rebuild it—nothing’s locked away.

Feature-Packed Out of the Box:

Home: Your dynamic welcome mat, complete with social links (Facebook, Instagram, LinkedIn, TikTok, Twitter) and a cheeky “Download Course” button (hint: update that link!).

About: Meet Fitsum—13 years in graphics & web development, juggled Java, C/C++, Photon, and now exploring the cosmos at NASA. An honest bio that tells it like it is.

Service & Contact: Placeholder pages waiting for your offerings and inbox to fill up.

Login: Simple form scaffold to get you started on user auth.

Project Showcase: A blank canvas to flaunt your masterpieces.

Todo App: Dive into React state with a classic task manager.

Rock-Paper-Scissors (RPS): A playful mini-game—because building web apps should also be a game!

Expense tracker list to track daily list: its gonna be used on day to day life!

Easily Extendable: Want more? Just drop a new component in /src/page, hook it up in App.jsx, and watch the magic.
